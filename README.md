## Coursera Applied Visualizations Project

### Code
This is the code and data for the final project for the course Coursera Apllied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python. You can clone this repository and run the code in an Jupyter or local Python environment. 

### Data
The data for this project was downloaded from baseball-reference.com (free version). See the URLs for details on the tables and the data dictionary. For convenience, I have exported the appropriate tables from baseball-reference.com so you will have the exact data needed.
